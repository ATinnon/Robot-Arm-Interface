# Robot-Arm-Interface
This project controls a LabVolt Armdroid 1000 via a Raspberry Pi and web interface.
While the robot movement script was provided, I developed the web control front end, integrated GPIO control logic, and debugged the interface.

The coding languages used for this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

I chose this project because it falls under both of my fields of study: Microprocessors and Automation and Control Systems.

I worked with a Yaskawa robot arm for a while doing a separate project involving dominoes, and I have taken many classes programming Arduinos paired with many ICs to do different things, so naturally, I would gravitate to this project.

The plan for the programming aspect is to use HTML and CSS to create and design the website on the front end. We use JavaScript to allow the tabs to be linked to the different HTML files so we can separate the code for each of the tabs, because I know that the Programming HTML file will have the most code, and to keep it neat.

On the backend of the website, Python will be used to control the robot and ask for user input on the website, which will connect to the Raspberry Pi to control the robot arm.
